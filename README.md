## Interactive BoM

The BoM (Bill Of Materials) is included as an interactive iBoM, generated using the excellent plugin https://github.com/turbobabr/easyeda-ibom-extension. It makes it very easy to verify that you have ordered all componenets, which componenets go where and that you have soldered them.
